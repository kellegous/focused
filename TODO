must do
= add ability to add a blocked site.
= create extension artwork.
= BUG: sometimes extension freaks out when laptop goes to sleep. A tab is unlocked and
  not visible when I leave my laptop. When I come back and switch to that tab, I get notification eruption.
= add line-height to my styles to prevent drift on different pages.
= create promotional images 440x280, 920x680, (1400x560)?
= create screenshots


could do
= PERF: lock screen trans w/ -webkit-transform
= lock tabs with restricted referrer.
= monitor tabs show/hide so that you don't come back to find a tab locked, but it
  slams shut in front of your eyes.
